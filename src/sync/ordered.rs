// This code was adapted from MIT licensed https://github.com/antialize/ordered-locks
// We cannot use that library directly as it is wrapping std::sync types

//! This create implement compiletime ordering of locks into levels, [`L1`], [`L2`], [`L3`], [`L4`] and [`L5`].
//! In order to acquire a lock at level `i` only locks at level `i-1` or below may be held.
//!
//! If locks are alwayes acquired in level order on all threads, then one cannot have a deadlock
//! involving only acquireng locks.
//!
//! In the following example we create two [muteces](Mutex) at level [`L1`] and [`L2`] and lock them
//! in the propper order.
//! ```
//! use ordered_locks::{L1, L2, Mutex, CleanLockToken};
//! // Create value at lock level 0, this lock cannot be acquired while a level1 lock is heldt
//! let v1 = Mutex::<L1, _>::new(42);
//! // Create value at lock level 1
//! let v2 = Mutex::<L2, _>::new(43);
//! // Construct a token indicating that this thread does not hold any locks
//! let mut token = unsafe {CleanLockToken::new()};
//!  
//! {
//!     // We can aquire the locks for v1 and v2 at the same time
//!     let mut g1 = v1.lock(token.token());
//!     let (g1, token) = g1.token_split();
//!     let mut g2 = v2.lock(token);
//!     *g2 = 11;
//!     *g1 = 12;
//! }
//! // Once the guards are dropped we can acquire other things
//! *v2.lock(token.token()) = 13;
//! ```
//!
//! In the following example we create two [muteces](Mutex) at level [`L1`] and [`L2`] and try to lock
//! the mutex at [`L1`] while already holding a [`Mutex`] at [`L2`] which failes to compile.
//! ```compile_fail
//! use ordered_locks::{L1, L2, Mutex, CleanLockToken};
//! // Create value at lock level 0, this lock cannot be acquired while a level1 lock is heldt
//! let v1 = Mutex::<L1, _>::new(42);
//! // Create value at lock level 1
//! let v2 = Mutex::<L2, _>::new(43);
//! // Construct a token indicating that this thread does not hold any locks
//! let mut clean_token = unsafe {CleanLockToken::new()};
//! let token = clean_token.token();
//!  
//! // Try to aquire locks in the wrong order
//! let mut g2 = v2.lock(token);
//! let (g2, token) = g2.token_split();
//! let mut g1 = v1.lock(token); // shouldn't compile!
//! *g2 = 11;
//! *g1 = 12;
//! ```
